           Hello, again. My name is Trey and I'm an aspiring Web Developer. 
           I have been interested in the world of coding for roughly
           two years now. However, I have had trouble deciding which path I should take. I started with <strong>Java</strong> 
           because it was one of the most used coding languages on the internet.
           And I became fairly fluent in the language, but I did not know how to use the information I learned to built real,
           meaningful projects. So I then moved on to another language, <strong>C#</strong>. I chose this language because
           it was required to use the <em>Unity</em> engine which I used to create prototype video games. As video games have 
           always peaked my interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            C# was a fun language to learn and it was especially fun to see code I've written come to life. But i realised 
            pretty quickly that <strong>Game Development</strong> was not something I could handle, as making all of the assets, music, art and
            code became too overwhelming for me to continue persuing. That's when I stubled apon Web Development. They say
            the third times the charm, and they hit the nail on the head with that one. I never considered that every single Page
            on the internet was created by someone, why can't it be me? It can, and it will! I enjoy seeing instant feedback on
            the code i create and I <strong>LOVE</strong> the problem solving side of coding. I've been meaning to take a crack at Web Development
            for a little while now but it was hard at first since I just had my daughter. But so far I've had a lot of fun and I'm excited
            to create tons of new projects!
